# odin-recipes
Recipes project in The Odin Project's foundations course

Introduction

It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

It’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
