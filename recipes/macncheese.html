        <li>One rotisserie-roasted chicken</li>
        <li>Six tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>Six tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">

        <li>Pour in milk, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute more. Reduce heat and season with pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir Cheddar and Monterey Jack into the sauce until melted and combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in hot sauce to the desired level of spiciness.</li>
        <li>Add Gorgonzola, chicken, and macaroni; mix well to combine. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
